          <center><p style="width: 80%; ">A cafe traditionally serves Tea, Coffee, soft drinks and usually a good selection of cakes. Some places offer sandwiches, light bites and even meals.

            Pubs focus more on alcohol and “nibbles"- being crisps, peanuts, pork scratching etc. Some pubs do offer meals also but usually a different caliber of food. 
            A “good" pub meal is homemade food, traditional English food such as burgers, Sunday dinners, pies etc.
            
            The atmosphere is different in cafes and pubs. Cafes are great for meeting up with family, mums and children, friends or elderly relatives.
             A decent cafe has a relaxed ambience with soft background music and a friendly face serving you your drinks etc.
            
            Whereas a pub, although can have equally a relaxing atmosphere, as it is focused more on alcohol can have a more upbeat atmosphere. 
            Some pubs play loud music or have live bands playing and a pub is commonly frequented on a night time. Some pubs have TV screens for 
            football games and other popular culture. A lot have pool tables darts boards, gambling machines and some offer a pub quiz once a week too.</p></center>
